spinecreator
============

A GUI for the creation and analysis of neural models using the SpineML format

This program needs to be compiled with QtCreator (http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/). It requires three other programs to execute models:

* https://github.com/sebjameswml/brahms
* https://github.com/SpineML/SpineML_PreFlight
* https://github.com/SpineML/SpineML_2_BRAHMS
