spinecreator
============

A GUI for the creation and analysis of neural models using the SpineML format

This program needs to be compiled with QtCreator against Qt 5.x
(http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/). It requires three other programs to
execute models:

* https://github.com/sebjameswml/brahms
* https://github.com/SpineML/SpineML_PreFlight
* https://github.com/SpineML/SpineML_2_BRAHMS

Build instructions can be found here:

SpineCreator will work on recent Macs and most recent Linux distros. Slightly
older distros may only provide Qt 4.x or may provide an older version of
Graphviz. You will need Qt 5.x and Graphviz 2.32 plus.
